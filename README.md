# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

## To start the project run
```
npm install 
```
## If using yarn, run 
```
yarn start
```
This will install the required dependencies

## To start node
Run 
```
npm run dev
```
This will run the Stacks.js file. <br>
To change the file you run open package.json and change filename.js to the file you want to run. <br>
That way nodemon will watch for changes to that file and automatically run node. 
```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon <filename.js>"
  }
```
